# 12-database-manager
# Description
In this project we were tasked with creating a database manager that would be useful for a company to manage their departments and employees. We were required to use Inquirer, MYSQL, and Node.js. 
This project gave me a deeper understanding of how to use inquirer to access and change databases. 

# Usage
In order to use the application please use the command "node inquirer.js".
